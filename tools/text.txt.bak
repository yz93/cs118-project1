For 56 years, the Maine Lobster Festival has been drawing crowds with the
promise of sun, fun, and fine food.  One visitor would argue that the
celebration involves a whole lot more.

The enormous, pungent, and extremely well marketed Maine Lobster Festival is
held every late July in the state’s midcoast region, meaning the western side of
Penobscot Bay, the nerve stem of Maine’s lobster industry.  What’s called the
midcoast runs from Owl’s Head and Thomaston in the south to Belfast in the
north.  (Actually, it might extend all the way up to Bucksport, but we were
never able to get farther north than Belfast on Route 1, whose summer traffic
is, as you can imagine, unimaginable.)  The region’s two main communities are
Camden, with its very old money and yachty harbor and five-star restaurants and
phenomenal B&Bs, and Rockland, a serious old fishing town that hosts the
Festival every summer in historic Harbor Park, right along the water.

Tourism and lobster are the midcoast region’s two main industries, and they’re
both warm-weather enterprises, and the Maine Lobster Festival represents less an
intersection of the industries than a deliberate collision, joyful and lucrative
and loud.  The assigned subject of this article is the 56th Annual MLF, July 30
to August 3, 2003, whose official theme was “Lighthouses, Laughter, and Lobster.”
Total paid attendance was over 80,000, due partly to a national CNN spot in June
during which a Senior Editor of a certain other epicurean magazine hailed the MLF
as one of the best food-themed festivals in the world.  2003 Festival highlights:
concerts by Lee Ann Womack and Orleans, annual Maine Sea Goddess beauty pageant,
Saturday’s big parade, Sunday’s William G.  Atwood Memorial Crate Race, annual
Amateur Cooking Competition, carnival rides and midway attractions and food
booths, and the MLF’s Main Eating Tent, where something over 25,000 pounds of
fresh-caught Maine lobster is consumed after preparation in the World’s Largest
Lobster Cooker near the grounds’ north entrance.  Also available are lobster
rolls, lobster turnovers, lobster sauté, Down East lobster salad, lobster bisque,
lobster ravioli, and deep-fried lobster dumplings.  Lobster Thermidor is
obtainable at a sit-down restaurant called The Black Pearl on Harbor Park’s
northwest wharf.  A large all-pine booth sponsored by the Maine Lobster Promotion
Council has free pamphlets with recipes, eating tips, and Lobster Fun Facts.  The
winner of Friday’s Amateur Cooking Competition prepares Saffron Lobster Ramekins,
the recipe for which is available for public downloading at
www.mainelobsterfestival.com.  There are lobster T-shirts and lobster bobblehead
dolls and inflatable lobster pool toys and clamp-on lobster hats with big scarlet
claws that wobble on springs.  Your assigned correspondent saw it all,
accompanied by one girlfriend and both his own parents—one of which parents was
actually born and raised in Maine, albeit in the extreme northern inland part,
which is potato country and a world away from the touristic midcoast.2

For practical purposes, everyone knows what a lobster is.  As usual, though,
there’s much more to know than most of us care about—it’s all a matter of what
your interests are.  Taxonomically speaking, a lobster is a marine crustacean of
the family Homaridae, characterized by five pairs of jointed legs, the first pair
terminating in large pincerish claws used for subduing prey.  Like many other
species of benthic carnivore, lobsters are both hunters and scavengers.  They
have stalked eyes, gills on their legs, and antennae.  There are dozens of
different kinds worldwide, of which the relevant species here is the Maine
lobster, Homarus americanus.  The name “lobster” comes from the Old English
loppestre, which is thought to be a corrupt form of the Latin word for locust
combined with the Old English loppe, which meant spider.

Moreover, a crustacean is an aquatic arthropod of the class Crustacea, which
comprises crabs, shrimp, barnacles, lobsters, and freshwater crayfish.  All this
is right there in the encyclopedia.  And an arthropod is an invertebrate member
of the phylum Arthropoda, which phylum covers insects, spiders, crustaceans, and
centipedes/millipedes, all of whose main commonality, besides the absence of a
centralized brain-spine assembly, is a chitinous exoskeleton composed of segments,
to which appendages are articulated in pairs.

The point is that lobsters are basically giant sea-insects.3  Like most
arthropods, they date from the Jurassic period, biologically so much older than
mammalia that they might as well be from another planet.  And they
are—particularly in their natural brown-green state, brandishing their claws like
weapons and with thick antennae awhip—not nice to look at.  And it’s true that
they are garbagemen of the sea, eaters of dead stuff,4 although they’ll also eat
some live shellfish, certain kinds of injured fish, and sometimes each other.

But they are themselves good eating.  Or so we think now.  Up until sometime in
the 1800s, though, lobster was literally low-class food, eaten only by the poor
and institutionalized.  Even in the harsh penal environment of early America,
some colonies had laws against feeding lobsters to inmates more than once a week
because it was thought to be cruel and unusual, like making people eat rats.
One reason for their low status was how plentiful lobsters were in old New
England.  “Unbelievable abundance” is how one source describes the situation,
including accounts of Plymouth pilgrims wading out and capturing all they wanted
by hand, and of early Boston’s seashore being littered with lobsters after hard
storms—these latter were treated as a smelly nuisance and 5ground up for
fertilizer.  There is also the fact that premodern lobster was often cooked dead
and then preserved, usually packed in salt or crude hermetic containers.  Maine’s
earliest lobster industry was based around a dozen such seaside canneries in the
1840s, from which lobster was shipped as far away as California, in demand only
because it was cheap and high in protein, basically chewable fuel.

Now, of course, lobster is posh, a delicacy, only a step or two down from caviar.
The meat is richer and more substantial than most fish, its taste subtle compared
to the marine-gaminess of mussels and clams.  In the U.S. pop-food imagination,
lobster is now the seafood analog to steak, with which it’s so often twinned as
Surf ’n’ Turf on the really expensive part of the chain steak house menu.

In fact, one obvious project of the MLF, and of its omnipresently sponsorial
Maine Lobster Promotion Council, is to counter the idea that lobster is unusually
luxe or rich or unhealthy or expensive, suitable only for effete palates or the
occasional blow-the-diet treat.  It is emphasized over and over in presentations
and pamphlets at the Festival that Maine lobster meat has fewer calories, less
cholesterol, and less saturated fat than chicken.5  And in the Main Eating Tent,
you can get a “quarter” (industry shorthand for a 1‰-pound lobster), a 4-ounce
cup of melted butter, a bag of chips, and a soft roll w/ butter-pat for around
$12.00, which is only slightly more expensive than supper at McDonald’s.

Be apprised, though, that the Main Eating Tent’s suppers come in Styrofoam trays,
and the soft drinks are iceless and flat, and the coffee is convenience-store
coffee in yet more Styrofoam, and the utensils are plastic (there are none of the
special long skinny forks for pushing out the tail meat, though a few savvy
diners bring their own).  Nor do they give you near enough napkins, considering
how messy lobster is to eat, especially when you’re squeezed onto benches
alongside children of various ages and vastly different levels of fine-motor
development—not to mention the people who’ve somehow smuggled in their own beer
in enormous aisle-blocking coolers, or who all of a sudden produce their own
plastic tablecloths and try to spread them over large portions of tables to try
to reserve them (the tables) for their little groups.  And so on.
Any one example is no more than a petty inconvenience, of course, but the MLF
turns out to be full of irksome little downers like this—see for instance the
Main Stage’s headliner shows, where it turns out that you have to pay $20 extra
for a folding chair if you want to sit down; or the North Tent’s mad scramble
for the NyQuil-cup-size samples of finalists’ entries handed out after the
Cooking Competition; or the much-touted Maine Sea Goddess pageant finals, which
turn out to be excruciatingly long and to consist mainly of endless thanks and
tributes to local sponsors.  What the Maine Lobster Festival really is is a
mid­level county fair with a culinary hook, and in this respect it’s not unlike
Tidewater crab festivals, Midwest corn festivals, Texas chili festivals, etc.,
and shares with these venues the core paradox of all teeming commercial demotic
events: It’s not for everyone.6  Nothing against the aforementioned euphoric
Senior Editor, but I’d be surprised if she’d spent much time here in Harbor Park,
watching people slap canal-zone mosquitoes as they eat deep-fried Twinkies and
watch Professor Paddywhack, on six-foot stilts in a raincoat with plastic
lobsters protruding from all directions on springs, terrify their children.

Lobster is essentially a summer food.  This is because we now prefer our lobsters
fresh, which means they have to be recently caught, which for both tactical and
economic reasons takes place at depths of less than 25 fathoms.  Lobsters tend
to be hungriest and most active (i.e., most trappable) at summer water
temperatures of 45–50°F. In the autumn, some Maine lobsters migrate out into
deeper water, either for warmth or to avoid the heavy waves that pound New
England’s coast all winter. Some burrow into the bottom. They might hibernate;
nobody’s sure. Summer is also lobsters’ molting season—specifically early to
mid-July. Chitinous arthropods grow by molting, rather the way people have to
buy bigger clothes as they age and gain weight.  Since lobsters can live to be
over 100, they can also get to be quite large, as in 20 pounds or more—though
truly senior lobsters are rare now, because New England’s waters are so heavily
trapped.7 Anyway, hence the culinary distinction between hard- and soft-shell
lobsters, the latter sometimes a.k.a. shedders. A soft-shell lobster is one that
has recently molted. In midcoast restaurants, the summer menu often offers both
kinds, with shedders being slightly cheaper even though they’re easier to
dismantle and the meat is allegedly sweeter. The reason for the discount is that
a molting lobster uses a layer of seawater for insulation while its new shell is
hardening, so there’s slightly less actual meat when you crack open a shedder,
plus a redolent gout of water that gets all over everything and can sometimes jet
out lemonlike and catch a tablemate right in the eye. If it’s winter or you’re
buying lobster someplace far from New England, on the other hand, you can almost
bet that the lobster is a hard-shell, which for obvious reasons travel better.

As an à la carte entrée, lobster can be baked, broiled, steamed, grilled,
sautéed, stir-fried, or microwaved. The most common method, though, is boiling.
If you’re someone who enjoys having lobster at home, this is probably the way you
do it, since boiling is so easy. You need a large kettle w/ cover, which you fill
about half full with water (the standard advice is that you want 2.5 quarts of
water per lobster). Seawater is optimal, or you can add two tbsp salt per quart
from the tap. It also helps to know how much your lobsters weigh. You get the
water boiling, put in the lobsters one at a time, cover the kettle, and bring it
back up to a boil. Then you bank the heat and let the kettle simmer—ten minutes
for the first pound of lobster, then three minutes for each pound after that.
(This is assuming you’ve got hard-shell lobsters, which, again, if you don’t
live between Boston and Halifax, is probably what you’ve got. For shedders,
you’re supposed to subtract three minutes from the total.) The reason the
kettle’s lobsters turn scarlet is that boiling somehow suppresses every pigment
in their chitin but one. If you want an easy test of whether the lobsters are
done, you try pulling on one of their antennae—if it comes out of the head with
minimal effort, you’re ready to eat.

A detail so obvious that most recipes don’t even bother to mention it is that
each lobster is supposed to be alive when you put it in the kettle. This is part
of lobster’s modern appeal: It’s the freshest food there is. There’s no
decomposition between harvesting and eating. And not only do lobsters require no
cleaning or dressing or plucking (though the mechanics of actually eating them
are a different matter), but they’re relatively easy for vendors to keep alive.
They come up alive in the traps, are placed in containers of seawater, and can,
so long as the water’s aerated and the animals’ claws are pegged or banded to
keep them from tearing one another up under the stresses of captivity,8 survive
right up until they’re boiled. Most of us have been in supermarkets or
restaurants that feature tanks of live lobster, from which you can pick out your
supper while it watches you point. And part of the overall spectacle of the Maine
Lobster Festival is that you can see actual lobstermen’s vessels docking at the
wharves along the northeast grounds and unloading freshly caught product, which
is transferred by hand or cart 100 yards to the great clear tanks stacked up
around the Festival’s cooker—which is, as mentioned, billed as the World’s
Largest Lobster Cooker and can process over 100 lobsters at a time for the Main
Eating Tent.

So then here is a question that’s all but unavoidable at the World’s Largest
Lobster Cooker, and may arise in kitchens across the U.S.: Is it all right to
boil a sentient creature alive just for our gustatory pleasure? A related set of
concerns: Is the previous question irksomely PC or sentimental? What does “all
right” even mean in this context? Is it all just a matter of individual choice?

As you may or may not know, a certain well-known group called People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals thinks that the morality of lobster-boiling is not
just a matter of individual conscience. In fact, one of the very first things we
hear about the MLF …well, to set the scene: We’re coming in by cab from the
almost indescribably odd and rustic Knox County Airport9 very late on the night
before the Festival opens, sharing the cab with a wealthy political consultant
who lives on Vinalhaven Island in the bay half the year (he’s headed for the
island ferry in Rockland). The consultant and cabdriver are responding to
informal journalistic probes about how people who live in the midcoast region
actually view the MLF, as in is the Festival just a big-dollar tourist thing or
is it something local residents look forward to attending, take genuine civic
pride in, etc. The cabdriver—who’s in his seventies, one of apparently a whole
platoon of retirees the cab company puts on to help with the summer rush, and
wears a U.S.-flag lapel pin, and drives in what can only be called a very
deliberate way—assures us that locals do endorse and enjoy the MLF, although
he himself hasn’t gone in years, and now come to think of it no one he and his
wife know has, either. However, the demilocal consultant’s been to recent
Festivals a couple times (one gets the impression it was at his wife’s behest),
of which his most vivid impression was that “you have to line up for an ungodly
long time to get your lobsters, and meanwhile there are all these ex–flower
children coming up and down along the line handing out pamphlets that say the
lobsters die in terrible pain and you shouldn’t eat them.”

And it turns out that the post-hippies of the consultant’s recollection were
activists from PETA. There were no PETA people in obvious view at the 2003
MLF,10 but they’ve been conspicuous at many of the recent Festivals. Since at
least the mid-1990s, articles in everything from The Camden Herald to The New
York Times have described PETA urging boycotts of the MLF, often deploying
celebrity spokespeople like Mary Tyler Moore for open letters and ads saying
stuff like “Lobsters are extraordinarily sensitive” and “To me, eating a
lobster is out of the question.” More concrete is the oral testimony of Dick,
our florid and extremely gregarious rental-car guy, to the effect that PETA’s
been around so much in recent years that a kind of brittlely tolerant
homeostasis now obtains between the activists and the Festival’s locals, e.g.:
“We had some incidents a couple years ago. One lady took most of her clothes
off and painted herself like a lobster, almost got herself arrested. But for
the most part they’re let alone. [Rapid series of small ambiguous laughs,
which with Dick happens a lot.] They do their thing and we do our thing.”

This whole interchange takes place on Route 1, 30 July, during a four-mile,
50-minute ride from the airport11 to the dealership to sign car-rental papers.
Several irreproducible segues down the road from the PETA anecdotes,
Dick—whose son-in-law happens to be a professional lobsterman and one of the
Main Eating Tent’s regular suppliers—articulates what he and his family feel
is the crucial mitigating factor in the whole morality-of-boiling-lobsters-alive
issue: “There’s a part of the brain in people and animals that lets us feel pain,
and lobsters’ brains don’t have this part.”

Besides the fact that it’s incorrect in about 11 different ways, the main reason
Dick’s statement is interesting is that its thesis is more or less echoed by the
Festival’s own pronouncement on lobsters and pain, which is part of a Test Your
Lobster IQ quiz that appears in the 2003 MLF program courtesy of the Maine Lobster
Promotion Council: “The nervous system of a lobster is very simple, and is in fact
 most similar to the nervous system of the grasshopper. It is decentralized with
no brain. There is no cerebral cortex, which in humans is the area of the brain
that gives the experience of pain.”

Though it sounds more sophisticated, a lot of the neurology in this latter claim
is still either false or fuzzy. The human cerebral cortex is the brain-part that
deals with higher faculties like reason, metaphysical self-awareness, language,
etc. Pain reception is known to be part of a much older and more primitive system
of nociceptors and prostaglandins that are managed by the brain stem and thalamus.12
On the other hand, it is true that the cerebral cortex is involved in what’s
variously called suffering, distress, or the emotional experience of pain—i.e.,
experiencing painful stimuli as unpleasant, very unpleasant, unbearable, and so
on.

Before we go any further, let’s acknowledge that the questions of whether and how
 different kinds of animals feel pain, and of whether and why it might be
justifiable to inflict pain on them in order to eat them, turn out to be extremely
complex and difficult. And comparative neuroanatomy is only part of the problem.
Since pain is a totally subjective mental experience, we do not have direct access
to anyone or anything’s pain but our own; and even just the principles by which we
can infer that others experience pain and have a legitimate interest in not
feeling pain involve hard-core philosophy—metaphysics, epistemology, value theory,
ethics. The fact that even the most highly evolved nonhuman mammals can’t use
language to communicate with us about their subjective mental experience is only
the first layer of additional complication in trying to extend our reasoning about
pain and morality to animals. And everything gets progressively more abstract and
convolved as we move farther and farther out from the higher-type mammals into
cattle and swine and dogs and cats and rodents, and then birds and fish, and
finally invertebrates like lobsters.

The more important point here, though, is that the whole animal-cruelty-and-eating
issue is not just complex, it’s also uncomfortable. It is, at any rate,
uncomfortable for me, and for just about everyone I know who enjoys a variety of
foods and yet does not want to see herself as cruel or unfeeling. As far as I can
tell, my own main way of dealing with this conflict has been to avoid thinking
about the whole unpleasant thing. I should add that it appears to me unlikely that
many readers of gourmet wish to think hard about it, either, or to be queried
about the morality of their eating habits in the pages of a culinary monthly.
Since, however, the assigned subject of this article is what it was like to attend
the 2003 MLF, and thus to spend several days in the midst of a great mass of
Americans all eating lobster, and thus to be more or less impelled to think hard
about lobster and the experience of buying and eating lobster, it turns out that
there is no honest way to avoid certain moral questions.

There are several reasons for this. For one thing, it’s not just that lobsters get
boiled alive, it’s that you do it yourself—or at least it’s done specifically for
you, on-site.13 As mentioned, the World’s Largest Lobster Cooker, which is
highlighted as an attraction in the Festival’s program, is right out there on the
MLF’s north grounds for everyone to see. Try to imagine a Nebraska Beef Festival14
at which part of the festivities is watching trucks pull up and the live cattle
get driven down the ramp and slaughtered right there on the World’s Largest
Killing Floor or something—there’s no way.

The intimacy of the whole thing is maximized at home, which of course is where
most lobster gets prepared and eaten (although note already the semiconscious
euphemism “prepared,” which in the case of lobsters really means killing them right
there in our kitchens). The basic scenario is that we come in from the store and
make our little preparations like getting the kettle filled and boiling, and then we
lift the lobsters out of the bag or whatever retail container they came home in
…whereupon some uncomfortable things start to happen. However stuporous the lobster
is from the trip home, for instance, it tends to come alarmingly to life when
placed in boiling water. If you’re tilting it from a container into the steaming
kettle, the lobster will sometimes try to cling to the container’s sides or even
to hook its claws over the kettle’s rim like a person trying to keep from going
over the edge of a roof. And worse is when the lobster’s fully immersed. Even if
you cover the kettle and turn away, you can usually hear the cover rattling and
clanking as the lobster tries to push it off. Or the creature’s claws scraping
the sides of the kettle as it thrashes around. The lobster, in other words,
behaves very much as you or I would behave if we were plunged into boiling water
(with the obvious exception of screaming).15 A blunter way to say this is that
the lobster acts as if it’s in terrible pain, causing some cooks to leave the
kitchen altogether and to take one of those little lightweight plastic oven
timers with them into another room and wait until the whole process is over.

There happen to be two main criteria that most ethicists agree on for determining
whether a living creature has the capacity to suffer and so has genuine interests
that it may or may not be our moral duty to consider.16 One is how much of the
neurological hardware required for pain-experience the animal comes equipped
with—nociceptors, prostaglandins, neuronal opioid receptors, etc. The other
criterion is whether the animal demonstrates behavior associated with pain. And
it takes a lot of intellectual gymnastics and behaviorist hairsplitting not to
see struggling, thrashing, and lid-clattering as just such pain-behavior.
According to marine zoologists, it usually takes lobsters between 35 and 45
seconds to die in boiling water. (No source I could find talked about how long
it takes them to die in superheated steam; one rather hopes it’s faster.)

There are, of course, other fairly common ways to kill your lobster on-site and
so achieve maximum freshness. Some cooks’ practice is to drive a sharp heavy
knife point-first into a spot just above the midpoint between the lobster’s
eyestalks (more or less where the Third Eye is in human foreheads). This is
alleged either to kill the lobster instantly or to render it insensate—and is
said at least to eliminate the cowardice involved in throwing a creature into
boiling water and then fleeing the room. As far as I can tell from talking to
proponents of the knife-in-the-head method, the idea is that it’s more violent
but ultimately more merciful, plus that a willingness to exert personal agency
and accept responsibility for stabbing the lobster’s head honors the lobster
somehow and entitles one to eat it. (There’s often a vague sort of Native
American spirituality-of-the-hunt flavor to pro-knife arguments.) But the problem
with the knife method is basic biology: Lobsters’ nervous systems operate off not
one but several ganglia, a.k.a. nerve bundles, which are sort of wired in series
and distributed all along the lobster’s underside, from stem to stern. And
disabling only the frontal ganglion does not normally result in quick death or
unconsciousness. Another alternative is to put the lobster in cold salt water and
then very slowly bring it up to a full boil. Cooks who advocate this method are
going mostly on the analogy to a frog, which can supposedly be kept from jumping
out of a boiling pot by heating the water incrementally. In order to save a lot
of research-summarizing, I’ll simply assure you that the analogy between frogs
and lobsters turns out not to hold.

Ultimately, the only certain virtues of the home-lobotomy and slow-heating methods
are comparative, because there are even worse/crueler ways people prepare lobster.
Time-thrifty cooks sometimes microwave them alive (usually after poking several
extra vent holes in the carapace, which is a precaution most shellfish-microwavers
learn about the hard way). Live dismemberment, on the other hand, is big in Europe:
Some chefs cut the lobster in half before cooking; others like to tear off the
claws and tail and toss only these parts in the pot.

And there’s more unhappy news respecting suffering-criterion number one. Lobsters
don’t have much in the way of eyesight or hearing, but they do have an exquisite
tactile sense, one facilitated by hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs that
protrude through their carapace. “Thus,” in the words of T.M. Prudden’s industry
classic About Lobster, “it is that although encased in what seems a solid,
impenetrable armor, the lobster can receive stimuli and impressions from without
as readily as if it possessed a soft and delicate skin.” And lobsters do have
nociceptors,17 as well as invertebrate versions of the prostaglandins and major
neurotransmitters via which our own brains register pain.

Lobsters do not, on the other hand, appear to have the equipment for making or
absorbing natural opioids like endorphins and enkephalins, which are what more
advanced nervous systems use to try to handle intense pain. From this fact,
though, one could conclude either that lobsters are maybe even more vulnerable
to pain, since they lack mammalian nervous systems’ built-in analgesia, or,
instead, that the absence of natural opioids implies an absence of the really
intense pain-sensations that natural opioids are designed to mitigate. I for one
can detect a marked upswing in mood as I contemplate this latter possibility: It
could be that their lack of endorphin/enkephalin hardware means that lobsters’
raw subjective experience of pain is so radically different from mammals’ that
it may not even deserve the term pain. Perhaps lobsters are more like those
frontal-lobotomy patients one reads about who report experiencing pain in a
totally different way than you and I. These patients evidently do feel physical
pain, neurologically speaking, but don’t dislike it—though neither do they like
it; it’s more that they feel it but don’t feel anything about it—the point being
that the pain is not distressing to them or something they want to get away from.
Maybe lobsters, who are also without frontal lobes, are detached from the
neurological-registration-of-injury-or-hazard we call pain in just the same way.
There is, after all, a difference between (1) pain as a purely neurological event,
and (2) actual suffering, which seems crucially to involve an emotional component,
an awareness of pain as unpleasant, as something to fear/dislike/want to avoid.

Still, after all the abstract intellection, there remain the facts of the
frantically clanking lid, the pathetic clinging to the edge of the pot. Standing
at the stove, it is hard to deny in any meaningful way that this is a living
creature experiencing pain and wishing to avoid/escape the painful experience.
To my lay mind, the lobster’s behavior in the kettle appears to be the expression
of a preference; and it may well be that an ability to form preferences is the
decisive criterion for real suffering.18 The logic of this (preference p suffering)
relation may be easiest to see in the negative case. If you cut certain kinds of
worms in half, the halves will often keep crawling around and going about their
vermiform business as if nothing had happened. When we assert, based on their
post-op behavior, that these worms appear not to be suffering, what we’re really
saying is that there’s no sign that the worms know anything bad has happened or
would prefer not to have gotten cut in half.

Lobsters, however, are known to exhibit preferences. Experiments have shown that
they can detect changes of only a degree or two in water temperature; one reason
for their complex migratory cycles (which can often cover 100-plus miles a year)
is to pursue the temperatures they like best.19 And, as mentioned, they’re
bottom-dwellers and do not like bright light: If a tank of food lobsters is out
in the sunlight or a store’s fluorescence, the lobsters will always congregate
in whatever part is darkest. Fairly solitary in the ocean, they also clearly
dislike the crowding that’s part of their captivity in tanks, since (as also
mentioned) one reason why lobsters’ claws are banded on capture is to keep them
from attacking one another under the stress of close-quarter storage.

In any event, at the Festival, standing by the bubbling tanks outside the
World’s Largest Lobster Cooker, watching the fresh-caught lobsters pile over
one another, wave their hobbled claws impotently, huddle in the rear corners,
or scrabble frantically back from the glass as you approach, it is difficult
not to sense that they’re unhappy, or frightened, even if it’s some rudimentary
version of these feelings …and, again, why does rudimentariness even enter into
it? Why is a primitive, inarticulate form of suffering less urgent or
uncomfortable for the person who’s helping to inflict it by paying for the food
it results in? I’m not trying to give you a PETA-like screed here—at least I
don’t think so. I’m trying, rather, to work out and articulate some of the
troubling questions that arise amid all the laughter and saltation and community
pride of the Maine Lobster Festival. The truth is that if you, the Festival
attendee, permit yourself to think that lobsters can suffer and would rather not,
the MLF can begin to take on aspects of something like a Roman circus or medieval
torture-fest.

Does that comparison seem a bit much? If so, exactly why? Or what about this
one: Is it not possible that future generations will regard our own present
agribusiness and eating practices in much the same way we now view Nero’s
entertainments or Aztec sacrifices? My own immediate reaction is that such a
comparison is hysterical, extreme—and yet the reason it seems extreme to me
appears to be that I believe animals are less morally important than human
beings;20 and when it comes to defending such a belief, even to myself, I have
to acknowledge that (a) I have an obvious selfish interest in this belief,
since I like to eat certain kinds of animals and want to be able to keep doing
it, and (b) I have not succeeded in working out any sort of personal ethical
system in which the belief is truly defensible instead of just selfishly
convenient.

Given this article’s venue and my own lack of culinary sophistication, I’m
curious about whether the reader can identify with any of these reactions and
acknowledgments and discomforts. I am also concerned not to come off as shrill
or preachy when what I really am is confused. Given the (possible) moral status
and (very possible) physical suffering of the animals involved, what ethical
convictions do gourmets evolve that allow them not just to eat but to savor and
enjoy flesh-based viands (since of course refined enjoyment, rather than just
ingestion, is the whole point of gastronomy)? And for those gourmets who’ll have
no truck with convictions or rationales and who regard stuff like the previous
paragraph as just so much pointless navel-gazing, what makes it feel okay, inside,
to dismiss the whole issue out of hand? That is, is their refusal to think about
any of this the product of actual thought, or is it just that they don’t want to
think about it? Do they ever think about their reluctance to think about it?
After all, isn’t being extra aware and attentive and thoughtful about one’s food
and its overall context part of what distinguishes a real gourmet? Or is all the
gourmet’s extra attention and sensibility just supposed to be aesthetic,
gustatory?

These last couple queries, though, while sincere, obviously involve much larger
and more abstract questions about the connections (if any) between aesthetics
and morality, and these questions lead straightaway into such deep and
treacherous waters that it’s probably best to stop the public discussion right
here. There are limits to what even interested persons can ask of each other.

Footnotes:

There’s a comprehensive native apothegm: “Camden by the sea, Rockland by the
smell.”  N.B. All personally connected parties have made it clear from the start
that they do not want to be talked about in this article.  Midcoasters’ native
term for a lobster is, in fact, “bug,” as in “Come around on Sunday and we’ll
cook up some bugs.”  Factoid: Lobster traps are usually baited with dead
herring.  Of course, the common practice of dipping the lobster meat in melted
butter torpedoes all these happy fat-specs, which none of the Council’s
promotional stuff ever mentions, any more than potato-industry PR talks about
sour cream and bacon bits.  In truth, there’s a great deal to be said about
the differences between working-class Rockland and the heavily populist flavor
of its Festival versus comfortable and elitist Camden with its expensive view
and shops given entirely over to $200 sweaters and great rows of Victorian homes
converted to upscale B&Bs. And about these differences as two sides of the great
coin that is U.S. tourism. Very little of which will be said here, except to
amplify the above-mentioned paradox and to reveal your assigned correspondent’s
own preferences. I confess that I have never understood why so many people’s idea
of a fun vacation is to don flip-flops and sunglasses and crawl through maddening
traffic to loud hot crowded tourist venues in order to sample a “local flavor”
that is by definition ruined by the presence of tourists. This may (as my Festival
companions keep pointing out) all be a matter of personality and hardwired taste:
The fact that I just do not like tourist venues means that I’ll never understand
their appeal and so am probably not the one to talk about it (the supposed
appeal).  But, since this note will almost surely not survive magazine-editing
anyway, here goes:

As I see it, it probably really is good for the soul to be a tourist, even if
it’s only once in a while. Not good for the soul in a refreshing or enlivening
way, though, but rather in a grim, steely-eyed,
let’s-look-honestly-at-the-facts-and-find-some-way-to-deal-with-them way. My
personal experience has not been that traveling around the country is broadening
or relaxing, or that radical changes in place and context have a salutary effect,
but rather that intranational tourism is radically constricting, and humbling in
the hardest way—hostile to my fantasy of being a real individual, of living
somehow outside and above it all. (Coming up is the part that my companions
find especially unhappy and repellent, a sure way to spoil the fun of vacation
travel:) To be a mass tourist, for me, is to become a pure late-date American:
alien, ignorant, greedy for something you cannot ever have, disappointed in a way
you can never admit. It is to spoil, by way of sheer ontology, the very
unspoiledness you are there to experience. It is to impose yourself on places
that in all noneconomic ways would be better, realer, without you. It is, in
lines and gridlock and transaction after transaction, to confront a dimension of
yourself that is as inescapable as it is painful: As a tourist, you become
economically significant but existentially loathsome, an insect on a dead thing.

Datum: In a good year, the U.S. industry produces around 80 million pounds of
lobster, and Maine accounts for more than half that total.  N.B. Similar
reasoning underlies the practice of what’s termed “debeaking” broiler chickens
and brood hens in modern factory farms. Maximum commercial efficiency requires
that enormous poultry populations be confined in unnaturally close quarters,
under which conditions many birds go crazy and peck one another to death. As a
purely observational side-note, be apprised that debeaking is usually an
automated process and that the chickens receive no anesthetic. It’s not clear to
me whether most gourmet readers know about debeaking, or about related practices
like dehorning cattle in commercial feedlots, cropping swine’s tails in factory
hog farms to keep psychotically bored neighbors from chewing them off, and so
forth. It so happens that your assigned correspondent knew almost nothing about
standard meat-industry operations before starting work on this article.  The
terminal used to be somebody’s house, for example, and the lost-luggage-reporting
room was clearly once a pantry.  It turned out that one Mr. William R.
Rivas-Rivas, a high-ranking PETA official out of the group’s Virginia
headquarters, was indeed there this year, albeit solo, working the Festival’s main
and side entrances on Saturday, August 2, handing out pamphlets and adhesive
stickers emblazoned with “Being Boiled Hurts,” which is the tagline in most of
PETA’s published material about lobster. I learned that he’d been there only later,
when speaking with Mr. Rivas-Rivas on the phone. I’m not sure how we missed seeing
him in situ at the Festival, and I can’t see much to do except apologize for the
oversight—although it’s also true that Saturday was the day of the big MLF parade
through Rockland, which basic journalistic responsibility seemed to require going
to (and which, with all due respect, meant that Saturday was maybe not the best
day for PETA to work the Harbor Park grounds, especially if it was going to be
just one person for one day, since a lot of diehard MLF partisans were off-site
watching the parade (which, again with no offense intended, was in truth kind of
cheesy and boring, consisting mostly of slow homemade floats and various midcoast
people waving at one another, and with an extremely annoying man dressed as
Blackbeard ranging up and down the length of the crowd saying “Arrr” over and
over and brandishing a plastic sword at people, etc.; plus it rained)).  The short
version regarding why we were back at the airport after already arriving the
previous night involves lost luggage and a miscommunication about where and what
the local National Car Rental franchise was—Dick came out personally to the
airport and got us, out of no evident motive but kindness. (He also talked
nonstop the entire way, with a very distinctive speaking style that can be
described only as manically laconic; the truth is that I now know more about this
man than I do about some members of my own family.)  To elaborate by way of
example: The common experience of accidentally touching a hot stove and yanking
your hand back before you’re even aware that anything’s going on is explained by
the fact that many of the processes by which we detect and avoid painful stimuli
do not involve the cortex. In the case of the hand and stove, the brain is
bypassed altogether; all the important neurochemical action takes place in the
spine.  Morality-wise, let’s concede that this cuts both ways. Lobster-eating is
at least not abetted by the system of corporate factory farms that produces most
beef, pork, and chicken. Because, if nothing else, of the way they’re marketed
and packaged for sale, we eat these latter meats without having to consider that
they were once conscious, sentient creatures to whom horrible things were done.
(N.B. PETA distributes a certain video—the title of which is being omitted as
part of the elaborate editorial compromise by which this note appears at all—in
which you can see just about everything meat--related you don’t want to see or
think about. (N.B.2 Not that PETA’s any sort of font of unspun truth. Like many
partisans in complex moral disputes, the PETA people are -fanatics, and a lot of
 their rhetoric seems simplistic and self-righteous. Personally, though, I have
to say that I found this unnamed video both credible and deeply upsetting.))  Is
it significant that “lobster,” “fish,” and “chicken” are our culture’s words for
both the animal and the meat, whereas most mammals seem to require euphemisms
like “beef” and “pork” that help us separate the meat we eat from the living
creature the meat once was? Is this evidence that some kind of deep unease about
eating higher animals is endemic enough to show up in English usage, but that
the unease diminishes as we move out of the mammalian order? (And is “lamb”/“lamb”
the counterexample that sinks the whole theory, or are there special,
biblico-historical reasons for that equivalence?)
There’s a relevant populist myth about the high-pitched whistling sound that
sometimes issues from a pot of boiling lobster. The sound is really vented steam
from the layer of seawater between the lobster’s flesh and its carapace (this is
why shedders whistle more than hard-shells), but the pop version has it that the
sound is the lobster’s rabbitlike death scream. Lobsters communicate via
pheromones in their urine and don’t have anything close to the vocal equipment
for screaming, but the myth’s very persistent—which might, once again, point to
a low-level cultural unease about the boiling thing.  “Interests” basically means
strong and legitimate preferences, which obviously require some degree of
consciousness, responsiveness to stimuli, etc. See, for instance, the utilitarian
philosopher Peter Singer, whose 1974 Animal Liberation is more or less the bible
of the modern animal-rights movement: “It would be nonsense to say that it was not
in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone
does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it
could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand,
does have an interest in not being kicked along the road, because it will suffer
if it is.”  This is the neurological term for special pain receptors that are
(according to Jane A. Smith and Kenneth M. Boyd’s Lives in the Balance) “sensitive
to potentially damaging extremes of temperature, to mechanical forces, and to
chemical substances which are released when body tissues are damaged.”
“Preference”  is maybe roughly synonymous with “interest,” but it is a better
term for our purposes because it’s less abstractly philosophical—“preference” seems
more personal, and it’s the whole idea of a living creature’s personal experience
that’s at issue.  Of course, the most common sort of counterargument here would
begin by objecting that “like best” is really just a metaphor, and a misleadingly
anthropomorphic one at that. The counterarguer would posit that the lobster seeks
to maintain a certain optimal ambient temperature out of nothing but unconscious
instinct (with a similar explanation for the low-light affinities about to be
mentioned in the main text). The thrust of such a counterargument will be that the
lobster’s thrashings and clankings in the kettle express not unpreferred pain but
involuntary reflexes, like your leg shooting out when the doctor hits your knee.
Be advised that there are professional scientists, including many researchers who
use animals in experiments, who hold to the view that nonhuman creatures have no
real feelings at all, only “behaviors.” Be further advised that this view has a
long history that goes all the way back to Descartes, although its modern support
comes mostly from behaviorist psychology.

To these what-look-like-pain-are-really-only-reflexes counterarguments,
however, there happen to be all sorts of scientific and pro-animal-rights
countercounterarguments. And then further attempted rebuttals and redirects, and
 so on. Suffice to say that both the scientific and the philosophical arguments
on either side of the animal-suffering issue are involved, abstruse, technical,
often informed by self-interest or ideology, and in the end so totally
inconclusive that as a practical matter, in the kitchen or restaurant, it all
still seems to come down to individual conscience, going with (no pun) your gut.

Meaning a lot less important, apparently, since the moral comparison here is
not the value of one human’s life vs. the value of one animal’s life, but
rather the value of one animal’s life vs. the value of one human’s taste for a
particular kind of protein. Even the most diehard carniphile will acknowledge
that it’s possible to live and eat well without consuming animals.
